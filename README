== Project: Youpon Prototype 2 Rails Service ==
== Author: Garrison Prinslow ==

This is a basic Rails service that was created using scaffolding to integrate with the Youpon Prototype 2 iPhone application.

It supports the basic "Offers" data model in the project.  It was modified to add JSON support for GET and CREATE methods.
